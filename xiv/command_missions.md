# Squadron Missions
i.e. how to level your alts without doing work

## What is it
Squadron missions involves taking your squad and going into dungeons which is a really good source of exp. To unlock them, reach Squadron Rank 2. Complete your Grand Company hunt logs and finish the side quests which involve Aurum Vale and Dzemael Darkhold.

## What do I bring in?
Ideally you queue in as a DPS, since healers and tanks have short enough queues that those are better for leveling.
My squadron was Conjurer/Gladiator/Archer. I think ranged DPS is preferred in the other DPS slot its easier for them to avoid enemy AOES.

## Squadron Notes
Your Squadron is actually fairly strong, but not smart. They will get hit by a lot of things.

Squadron Benefits:

- Does not need to manage MP.
- Are unaffected by most dungeon mechanics (e.g. all of Aurum Vale)
- Tactics give them lots of free stats

Squadron Limitations:

- Will not try to dodge AOEs
- Will not try to grab adds unless they are nearby.
- Ignores dungeon mechanics like the boss being invulnerable in Halatali, which means you have to switch over and engage certain targets.

Other limitations:

- If you die you'll go back to the beginning of the dungeon. 
- You're considered the only actual player, so mechanics that would normally target other players will end up targeting you.
- The healer AI doesn't seem to heal you unless you're at 70% or lower health

## Tactics
Tactics are basically stat bonuses. Talk to your units between missions and you can assign tactics.

There are 4 different types of tactics that can be assigned to each member of your squadron.

| Tactic      | HP  | Damage | Defense |
|-------------|-----|--------|---------|
| Independent | +   | +      | +       |
| Offensive   |     | +++    |         |
| Defensive   | +++ |        | +++     |
| Balanced    | ++  | ++     |         |

These are obtained randomly by completing command missions. 
For DPS and healer, assign Offensive.
For tank assign Defensive.
The higher levels bonuses are nice though so keep that in mind if you have level 5 balanced vs level 1 offensive.

## Squadron Orders

Engage - Tells squad to attack whatever you're targeting. Use this to attack things.
Disengage / Re-engage - Tells squad to fallback or go back in. Use this if you want your squad to stop attacking.
Execute Limit Break - Special squadron limit break. Single target hit, boosts damage of the party by 30% for 15 seconds. Your party will stop all actions while this is being cast, so be careful. I hardly use this.

I suggest binding F11 to a mouse button (target nearest enemy) and engage to another mouse button.
Then you can just target and engage easily.

## General Strategy

### Mobs

TL;DR: Move forward -> See enemy -> Target enemy -> Engage -> Go do something else for a minute or two -> Repeat

Most mobs are weak enough that your squad can take care of it without worry.
As long as you're close enough, you can use Engage and watch as your tank goes in to aggro. The rest of your team will come in to kill. You can actually pull quite a bit, but if you do pull too much your team will die.
Your tank isn't very good at drawing aggro that's far away, so be sure to just use Engage from a safe distance.
If you do happen to draw aggro, try to pull the mobs near your tank so that they can draw aggro instead.

### Bosses

For some bosses, you can idle and literally do nothing. For others, you have to constantly move around so you might as well attack to make the boss die faster. 
Your squad will basically ignore any mechs, so you'll have to handle them yourself.
Bosses can and will target you with player-specific attacks. If you're a caster, you'll oftentimes have to just run.

Some bosses will be too difficult to kill and are not worth farming. 

## Dungeons

#### Halatali
Grade: C

Mostly AFKable. Not that hard except for the end, where you have to tell your squad to constantly engage the adds or you'll end up dying.

#### The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak
Grade: B

First two bosses are easily AFKable, the last boss you just have to make sure that you pull the adds towards the tank. Other than that don't stand in poison and you'll be fine.

#### Brayflox's Longstop
Grade: A

Good EXP, not a lot of movement required, easy big pulls. Can AFK first boss. Second boss you have to either pop the bubble by yourself or use Engage and have your squad pop it. The last boss will always target you with poison, so just be sure to move out of it. If you're far away, the boss will never be near the poison and won't heal. Your squad is unaffected by poison.

#### The Stone Vigil
Grade: B

Bosses aren't AFKable at all, and it is fairly easy to die to the first boss unless you're paying close attention. You basically always want to be behind the boss if possible.

#### Dzemael Darkhold
Grade: C

I believe your squad is unaffected by the All-seeing Eye's "Eyes on Me" AOE, so just engage and move yourself into the crystal aura. The first boss is kind of annoying as you have to dis-engage and engage the boss/adds multiple times.  The second boss is easy as long as you keep moving. The last boss Batraal is very annoying, and you have to Engage the crystals as they spawn. Otherwise your squad will keep hitting an Invulnerable target. It's also possible to die if you're too close to the boss.

#### Aurum Vale
Grade: S

This is the best dungeon. It's a boatload of EXP and your squad basically ignores all mechanics. If you want extra EXP, make sure to let the Morbol fruit spawn Seedlings.
First boss just eat fruit every now and then. 
Second boss literally go to the left side and hide behind the rock. That's all you have to do.
Last boss just be sure to eat the fruit. Sometimes however your squad will get hit by "Bad Breath" and it's possible that you'll die due to no healing. If you're a caster, it's nice to LB the boss when it spawns Morbol fruit.

#### The Wanderer's Palace 
Grade: F

Don't do this, the Tonberry stalker will get your squad killed. I believe the EXP isn't even worth it here.

#### Other 50 Dungeons
Haven't done. Try using MSQ Roulette or more Aurum Vale to level to 53.

#### Sohm AL
Grade: B

Easy AFK, but bosses are hard.
First boss: Just keep attacking. Even if you get sucked in you can just move out.
Be sure to bait out the fire/ice dragons into coming out. Engage and basically move all the way back and have your squad take care of everything else.

Second boss: This is annoying. All of the boss's targeting attacks will hit you. Just be sure to stay near one other person, even if the marker is blue. Remember that the boss jumps a lot, so your allies will try to follow. There is a chance that your healer will not heal in time for Primordial Roar any you'll die. When the green slime spawns (second set of "adds"), be sure to Engage it and kill it quickly, otherwise there's a good chance you'll die.
Tiomat: Things will target you and if they do you need to move. During the middle of the fight Tiomat will become invincible and you'll have to Engage on the two wings. While this is happening you'll constantly get hit by meteors, but as long as you keep moving you should be fine. Not hard.

#### The Vault
TBD
